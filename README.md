# internfair_iitg

As part of Enterpreneurship Cell, IIT guwahati, I along with 2 of my friends created this internship portal, where recruiters(mainly startups) can post internship offers and students can apply for the same.  It was used by 42+ startups and 300+ student.

It was built using html, css , bootstrap, vanilla javascript and django(python backend framework).

some screenshots of working site attached below
